# <i>ðŸ‘‰Series-Analyzer-and-Generator-Using-8086-Microprocessor.</i>

##  *âœ… Project Overview*

In this project, there are two sections: **Series Analyzer** and **Series Generator**. Letâ€™s discuss both sections:<br>

**ðŸš©The formula for the Nth element of a series is given by:** <br>
*Tn = a + ( n - 1 ) x d* <br><br>
Where:
-  Tn  = Nth element of the series
-  a  = First element of the series
-  n = Number of elements in the series
-  d  = Difference between two consecutive elements in the series

**ðŸš©The sum of the first \( n \) elements of a series is given by:** <br>
*Sn=n Ã— ( 2a + ( n âˆ’ 1 ) Ã— d ) / 2* <br><br>
Where:
-  Sn  = Sum of the first n elements
-  n  = Number of elements
-  a  = First element
-  d  = Difference between consecutive elements<br>

**Series analyzer:** For a given series it will find the difference by which the series was built and store the result in a location. Then find the sum of the n element and store into the next element.
<br><br>
**Series Generator:** IF the data like difference between two respective elements and the first element is given then the series can be built. The Nth element of the series and sum of N element can be found.
